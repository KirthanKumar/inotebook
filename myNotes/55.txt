#55 - iNotebook React Project Setup :
npm i react-router-dom concurrently
npm i concurrently
concurrently -> Run multiple commands concurrently.

added this to scripts section package.json: 
"both":"concurrently \"npm run start\" \"nodemon backend/index.js\""

after this if we do 'npm both' or 'npm run both', both the commans will run simultaneously.

https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/  we can use this also but we are not.
